# Hierarchical-Deterministic Password Generator
HDPasswordGenerator is a password generator and manager that offers a solution for recovering passwords on another machine if they are lost. The technique used for this is based on the bip32 and bip39 standards used in cryptocurrency wallets (described below) for the generation of deterministic and hierarchical keys.
